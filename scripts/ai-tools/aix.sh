# Prepare a command for execution using Claude

prompt="
You are a command line expert. Given a task, respond with a oneliner, that can
be executed in Bash shell and would satisfy task instructions. I value readable
output, long variant of arguments. DO output 2 lines: first line with short
explanation of its arguments and second line with the oneliner command. Never
output markdown. Prefer fd (fd-find) over find for file searching and rg (ripgrep) over grep for text searching.
<example>
List directory contents [ls -l] a long listing format [ls -t] sort by modification time, newest first
ls -lt
</example>

# Get Claude's response
response=$(claude -p "$prompt Task: $input")

# Add blank line at the beginning
echo ""

# Split response into lines and color appropriately
# IFS sets field separator to newline, -r disables backslash escaping,
# -d '' reads until null byte, -a stores in array, <<< feeds string as input
IFS=$'\n' read -rd '' -a lines <<< "$response"

# Check if we have at least 2 lines (${#lines[@]} gets array length)
if [[ ${#lines[@]} -ge 2 ]]; then
    # Color first line (explanation) dimmed gray
    echo -e "\033[2;37m${lines[0]}\033[0m"
    
    # Get the command from second line
