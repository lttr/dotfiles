description: Create a git commit with intelligent message generation
argument-hint: [commit message] [no-claude] [multi]
---

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes, create git commits following the standard Claude commit workflow.

**Arguments handling:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "multi", create multiple logical commits instead of a single commit
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a commit message (excluding "no-claude" and "multi"), use it as the commit message for single commit mode
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains "no-claude" anywhere, omit the Claude attribution from the commit message(s)
- If no commit message provided in arguments, generate one based on the changes

**Multi-commit behavior (when "multi" is specified):**
- Stage changes and write a set of logical commits for them
- Show initial status with `git status --short`
- Record initial commit with `git rev-parse HEAD`
- After creating commits, show summary of new commits created
- Display new commits with `git log --oneline` and recent commits for context

**Single commit behavior (default):**
- Create one commit with all relevant changes

**Attribution:**
- By default, include the standard Claude attribution:
```
ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```
- If "no-claude" appears in `$ARGUMENTS`, omit the attribution
