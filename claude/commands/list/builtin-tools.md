## Context

Claude Code has a set of built-in tools that are always available, separate from MCP server tools. Users may want to see what built-in tools are available for reference.

## Your task

List all built-in Claude Code tools (excluding MCP tools that start with `mcp__`).

For each tool, provide:

- Tool name in `tilde-separated` format
- Brief description (one line)

Organize by category:

- File Operations
- Execution & Shell
- Web Access
- Task Management
- Integration

Use compact format with minimal formatting.
