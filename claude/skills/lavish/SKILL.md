# Lavish Editor

Lavish Editor helps agents turn rich HTML artifacts into collaborative human review surfaces. Whenever you are about to give user a complex response that will be easier to understand via a rich / interactive page, consider using Lavish Editor. First generate an interactive HTML artifact according to user request, then run `lavish-axi <html-file>` so the user can visually review it, annotate elements or selected text, queue prompts, and send feedback back through `lavish-axi poll`.

## Prerequisite

`lavish-axi` is installed globally on this machine - invoke it directly as `lavish-axi <html-file>`.
Only if `lavish-axi` is not found on PATH, fall back to `vpx lavish-axi <html-file>`.
If lavish-axi output shows a follow-up command starting with `lavish-axi`, run it as-is.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

If the request above is non-empty, the user invoked `/lavish` explicitly - build an HTML artifact for that request now, following the workflow below.
If it is empty, infer what to visualize from the conversation.

## When to use

Use lavish-axi when the user asks for a visual artifact, HTML explainer, interactive prototype, review surface, product or technical plan, comparison, report, or browser-based feedback loop

## Workflow

1. Create the HTML artifact (default location `.lavish/<name>.html` in the working directory).
2. Run `lavish-axi <html-file>` to open or resume a review session in the browser.
3. Run `lavish-axi poll <html-file>` to long-poll for the user's annotations and queued prompts.
4. Apply the feedback, then poll again with `--agent-reply "<message>"` to reply in the browser and keep the loop going.
5. Run `lavish-axi end <html-file>` when the review is finished.

## Visual guidance

- Use visual hierarchy to make the most important decisions, risks, tradeoffs, and next actions obvious at a glance
- Use visual structure such as sections, cards, tables, diagrams, annotated snippets, and side-by-side comparisons instead of long prose
- Choose typography, spacing, color, and layout deliberately so the artifact has a clear point of view
- Prevent horizontal overflow: design narrow layouts intentionally, use minmax(0, 1fr) and min-width: 0 for grid/flex children, and deliberately wrap or truncate long labels/status text

## Playbooks

Run `lavish-axi playbook <id>` for focused, detailed guidance on any of these:

- `diagram` - Map relationships, flows, state, and architecture
- `table` - Turn dense records into scan-friendly review surfaces
- `comparison` - Show options, tradeoffs, and current vs target behavior
- `plan` - Explain a product or technical plan before implementation
- `diff` - Present code or PR changes with evidence and findings
- `input` - Must be used when the agent needs to collect user input on decisions, choices, preferences, triage, scope, or other structured feedback from within the artifact
- `slides` - Create a deliberate presentation when slides are requested

## Commands & rules

- Run `lavish-axi <html-file>` to open or resume a Lavish Editor session
- Unless the user specifies another location, create HTML artifacts in the current working directory under `.lavish/`
- Lavish serves the html file through a local express.js server. If your html needs to reference other filesystem assets such as images, CSS, fonts, and local scripts, copy them into the same directory as the HTML file, then reference them with relative paths from that directory. Never prepend `/` to those asset paths - root paths won't work
- Run `lavish-axi poll <html-file>` to wait for user feedback
- Run `lavish-axi end <html-file>` to end a session
- Run `lavish-axi stop` to shut down the background server (it also self-stops when idle or after the last session ends with nothing connected)
- Run `lavish-axi playbook <playbook_id>` for focused artifact guidance
- Lavish does not auto-inject any design system - artifacts stay portable so they render identically when opened directly without lavish-axi running. Choose a design system in this priority order: (1) if the user asked for a specific look or named design system, follow that; (2) otherwise, if the current project already has a design system or style conventions, match those so the artifact fits in; (3) otherwise, prefer the Lavish-recommended Tailwind CSS browser runtime v4 + DaisyUI v5, available via CDN - run `lavish-axi design` for a copy-pasteable CDN snippet plus component reference. Prefer that CDN snippet over hand-writing styles unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the user.
- Use lavish-axi when the user asks for a visual artifact, HTML explainer, interactive prototype, review surface, product or technical plan, comparison, report, or browser-based feedback loop
